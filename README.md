# FINAL-PROJECT

##hypothesis:
the Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) and Equatorial Pacific Sea Surface Temperatures (SST) anomalies are in negative correlations. And the correlations differed in different seasons.

##dateset:

https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/data/indices/olr

##summary of the analysis:

First, calculate the anomalies for SST and OLR. Second, make a comparison of SST and OLR from 1974 and 2021 seperataly. At last, calculate the correlation between SST and OLR in different seasons.
